# Project Guidelines

This repository contains the League Mod Toolkit - a collection of Rust crates for League of Legends modding, along with a Tauri-based GUI application.

## Code Comments & Documentation

### Comments

- **Avoid trivially descriptive comments** - Do not add comments that simply restate what the code does when it's obvious from the code itself.
- **Write comments for complexity** - Add comments when explaining:
  - Non-obvious business logic or domain-specific behavior
  - Complex algorithms or data transformations
  - Workarounds, edge cases, or "why" something is done a certain way
  - Performance considerations or trade-offs

```rust
// ❌ Bad - trivially descriptive
// Create a new vector
let items = Vec::new();

// ❌ Bad - just restates the code
// Loop through all files
for file in files {

// ✅ Good - explains non-obvious behavior
// WAD files can be either packed (single .wad.client file) or unpacked (directory structure).
// Packed WADs need extraction via WadExtractor, while unpacked can be copied directly.
if is_wad_file_name(relative_path) {
```

### Documentation

- **Document all public APIs** - Use `///` doc comments for public structs, enums, functions, and traits.
- **Include examples when helpful** - Doc comments support code examples with ```` ```rust ```` blocks.
- **Document error conditions** - Explain when functions can fail and what errors they return.
- **Keep doc comments concise but complete** - First line should be a summary, followed by details if needed.

```rust
/// Extractor for Fantome packages.
///
/// This struct provides functionality to extract a Fantome (.fantome) archive
/// to a mod project directory structure.
pub struct FantomeExtractor<R: Read + Seek> {

/// Extract the Fantome package to the specified output directory.
///
/// This will:
/// 1. Validate the archive structure
/// 2. Extract WAD contents to content/base/
/// 3. Extract README.md if present
/// 4. Extract thumbnail image if present
/// 5. Create a mod.config.json file
///
/// Returns the mod project configuration that was created.
pub fn extract_to(&mut self, output_dir: &Path) -> Result<FantomeExtractResult, FantomeExtractError> {
```

## Project Structure

- **Workspace crates** are in `crates/`
- **CLI tool**: `crates/league-mod/`
- **Library crates**: `crates/ltk_*`
- **GUI app**: `crates/ltk-manager/` (Tauri + React/TypeScript)

## Rust Conventions

- Use `miette` for user-facing error handling in the CLI
- Use `thiserror` for library error types
- Prefer the builder pattern for complex struct construction
- Write tests in a `#[cfg(test)]` module at the bottom of the file
- Use `camino` for UTF-8 path handling where appropriate

## TypeScript/React Conventions (ltk-manager)

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing component patterns in `src/components/`
- Use TanStack Router for routing
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
